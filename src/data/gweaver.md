    a lot along the way.

I decided to rebuild my personal site in React using GatsbyJs. Originally
the site was built in Angular and compiled with Middleman but I thought it was
about time I updated the framework and learnt something new. I also made some
minor design tweaks, you can find the repo <a href="https://github.com/garethweaver/public-site-react"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on my github</a>.</p>
