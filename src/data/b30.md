While working as a contractor at Business Three Zero I worked as part of a team
to create a native Ionic application for iOS, Android and web. The app was build
in Angular and deployed through the app stores as well as as a web application.
The app was for use as a modular platform to assist big businesses develop
their culture and values across large groups of employees.
