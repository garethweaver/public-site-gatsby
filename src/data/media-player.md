  description: I wrote an embedded HTML5 media player in CoffeeScript for Big Sofa
    which includes transcript support
---
During my time at Big Sofa I wrote a embedded HTML5 video transcript
player. It handled playlists of videos as well multiple languages and transcript
tags. You can check out a live version over at the Big Sofa API documentation.
The plugin is written solely in CoffeeScript.
